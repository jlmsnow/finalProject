## Summary
This is an R Markdown document I created for the final assignment of the course *Reproducible Templates for Analysis and Dissemination*. 
It includes a plot of the built-in "pressure" dataset and a table of the built-in "cars" dataset. 
Thank you for reviewing my work!

* The theme of this document is *Cerulean*

* Plot of pressure

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

* Table of the top 6 rows of cars data

```{r carstab, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(cars),
             caption = "Top 6 rows of the dataset cars")

```
